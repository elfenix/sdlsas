Installation Directions For SDL-Sasteroids:

Currently, SDL Sasteroids uses it's (mostly) original build system.

Requirements:
	A somewhat fast computer(Pentium+) is highly recommended, if your
	computer is slower than that, I'd suggest giving the old version
	of Sasteroids a try w/ an older distribution. :)

	The following libraries are required:
		SDL 1.2+
		SDL_ttf 
		SDL_mixer
		SDL_image
		Either SDL_gfx or OpenGL
	
	Everything else should work standard out-of-the-box.


To install:

First edit the Makefile, using a text editor,
edit major installation options there.

If you want, you can then edit src/gameconf.h to change several
game play options and values. 

From the SDLSasteroids directory(where this file resides)

run 'make'
run 'make install'

The binary should now be installed.
