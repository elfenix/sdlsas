Sasteroids ChangeLog

(See bottom of README file for credits)


v1.96.1 to v1.99
===========
	Changed layout of header files(more managable).
	
	Double sizing is now user configurable.
	
	Added some support for Win32(thanks Rainer Koschnick), note, still
	haven't tested on Windows, but it should be a bit more friendly,
	Windows users: LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS!
	
	User configuration actually means something now in game.conf.
	
	Fixed MANY graphical glitches and irritants.
	
	Windows may now resize.
	
	Sound support with SDL_mixer.
	
	Windows properly close.
	
	Low CPU systems, and hi latency no longer locks up game(thanks LIM,
	#sdl)

	Converted from .cf format, raw images, and pallete emulation to
	full SDL_Surfaces, and bitmap(bmp) files.

	Moved from old installation system to more standard make, make install
	installation.

	Added Copyright document(this game really needs one).

	Added new sounds.

	Misc. bug fixes to the firing system. :D

	Powerups! (Only 3 right now.)

	Be wary of green asteroids. =D

	Draw bars showing current weapon and shield power.

	Actually draw shield(and turn it on).

	
	
v1.96 to v1.96.1
===========
	Removed editor .swp files from distribution.


v1.5 to SDL Sasteroids 1.96
===========
	Where to begin?

	First, all references to svgalib have been removed.
	SoundIt library has been removed.

	Several classes have been reworked or rewritten completely.
	
	SDL support added.

	File structure changed - added src director, removed gamelib.

	Start of work to get 'configure; make; make install working'

 	Removed command line option parsing. (No good reason for removing...
	except trying to get everything compiling.)

	Now compiles and runs on gcc 2.95 and above.

	Removed old fonts and font system, added truetype font system. Added
	free truetype font.

	All changes have been made with an attempt to keep gameplay relatively
	close to what it was originally. I've kept all the backgrounds and
	in game credits the same. :)

v1.4 to 1.5
===========
	
	Finally -- sound! Real time sample mixing has been added using the
        soundIt library.  You need to have the voxware 2.9 or greater
        drivers in your linux kernel (this has been included in kernels
        since somewhere around 1.1.4?).  You also need a sound
        card capable of 8-bit digital sound playback. Sound samples are
        8-bit mono at 11,000hz.  Thanks to Hannu Savolainen for voxware!

	A man page 'sasteroids.6', written by Jeff Tranter
        (Jeff_Tranter@software.mitel.com). I hacked in some recent changes.

	The background screen option is now run-time configurable, instead
	of just compile time. Thanks to Bill Bogstad (bogstad@blaze.cs.jhu.edu)
	Use "-b off" to turn off the backdrop, and "-b on" to have it there.

	Fixed the "can't open /dev/kmem" problem with kernels
	1.1.38 and up. You'll need the recently released svgalib 1.2.0
	to compile.

	Ohhh- A new title page :-)

	Reorganization of files/code etc... Introduction of a new package
	called snd+gfx, which allows you to change the sound and graphics
	used in sasteroids. (contains utilities for modifying the .cf
	files)

	Probably some other changes... I don't remember..

v1.3 to 1.4 (minor update)
==========================
	(sound is very close.. but not yet..)

	If left own its own, sasteroids would sometimes crash with a
	floating point expection. Didn't occurr during normal game play.
	(required putting a max speed limit on objects after a bounce).
	Fixed that and also restores keyboard on a fatal error better.

	Added scoring information screen.

v1.2 to 1.3 (minor update)
==========================
	No sound yet! I'm working on it :-)

	Added a spacey backdrop during game play (thanks to John Remyn
        for the idea). You can turn this off by setting "BACKDROPS=NO" in
        the 'config' file before compiling, which you should do if you find
        the game is running too slow.

	You can now switch virtual consoles (vc's) during *game play* if you:
	1) pause the game by pressing 'p' first
	or,
	2) press 'q' to get the "End this game (y/n)" prompt.

	Compiling is much faster and requires MUCH less memory :-)  Why?
        All bitmaps are in a '.cf' file (thanks again to John Remyn for
        code/ideas/etc), instead of being compiled into the game code.

	Small changes in game play, more floating point code removed, etc..

	Minor bug fixes in level changing, and entering high score names.

	Changed format of highscore file from text to binary.  Gets rid of a
        few problems when spaces entered in a name.  Score files will
        automatically be updated to the new format by sasteroids.

	Default name for high score list taken from login name.

v1.1 to 1.2
============
	Added proper keyboard support for game play (using scancodes).
	Press the left arrow key to start rotating left, release the key to
	stop rotating, etc..  Note that you lose vc-switching (ALT-F?)
	during game play.  I'll try to fix this in a future version.

	99% of floating point math replaced with fixed point math. Results
	in a big speed increase on computer's without a FPU.

	A new alien that sort-of morphs from the medium sized asteroid.
        Doesn't shoot, just stumbles around trying to crash into you.  It
        takes a few shots to kill him.

	Changed the movement of the enemy spaceships to be a little more
	evil :-)

	More levels added, and the game play has changed a bit.  The
        shooting alien is a little tougher, but appears less often when the
        screen is filled with asteroids.

	New fonts.

	Fixed up the joystick control. Version 1.1 didn't allow for turning
	and thrusting at the same time.

	After crashing, indicator shows where your next ship will be placed.

	Changed color of enemy bullet so it's not confused with your own.

	Added the current level and # of shields remaining (either 1 or 0) to
	the bottom status line.

	Fixed bug in HiScore where some scores could be wiped out if blank
	names entered into list.

	The .xpm files we taking alot of space in the source distribution
	and weren't needed to compile the game, therefore I removed them
	and created a third package containing the tools needed to
	edit the graphics in the game.  email me if you want this, and
	I'll make it available.

	Billions and billions of other tiny changes.


v1.0 to v1.1
============

Compiling problems were fixed:

	Fixed up a few #include paths that were incorrect. Also got rid of
	the half-baked dependancies in the makefile.

	Removed the need to have ncurses installed.  Ncurses was only used
        for some simple keyboard handling.

	The high-scores file is no longer stored in the current directory,
	but is placed in /var/games (or where ever you wish). Also, the file
	is renamed from '.SastScores' to 'sast.scores' (no longer a hidden
	file)

Game control: 
	Added in joystick support - you need to have the joystick patches
        compiled into the kernel to use this (as of 1.0.9, the patches need
        to be applied).  If you don't have the joystick patches, or a
        joystick, you can still use the keyboard for control.

	Joytick control is:
	UP		Thrust
	LEFT		Rotate Left
	RIGHT		Rotate Right
	DOWN		Shield On
	BUTTON A	Fire, and start new ship
	BUTTON B	Hyperspace

Performance: 
	Performance under varying CPU loads should be better, but still
	not great.

	Removed floating point math from the explosion routines - should
        speed up the game a bit for users without a math co-pro.  This is
        still under development, and there's lots of fp math in other places.


Who cares:
	Lots more of the code was re-written in C++

	I've added the bitmaps I created for the game to the source
        distribution.  The files are in 'xpm' format.  See 1-BITMAPS if you
        feel like changing them (not included in binary distribution).
